# My Portfolio

### Overview 📋
A portfolio showcasing some of my front-end projects and sharing a bit about myself.

### Purpose 🎥
I had never designed a portfolio to tell more about myself, so I finally decided to create one while learning about React and TailwindCSS in the process. This page was designed following [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtGCTFXWV3Y).

### 🛠️ Built With:
- React/Vite
- TailwindCSS
